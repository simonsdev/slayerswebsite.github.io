    <p>Hey there, I'm <strong>John O'Reilly</strong>, the proud owner of <strong>Wheels on Fire</strong>. I've been in the car business for as long as I can remember — and if there's one thing I love more than a well-tuned engine, it's helping others find theirs. I’ve spent my life around cars — fixing them, restoring them, collecting them, and occasionally cursing at them. I'm a bit of a perfectionist — maybe even more with cars than with people, if I’m honest. Every vehicle in my collection has a story, and I believe the right car can bring out a bit of fire in anyone. This website is my digital garage. It's where I showcase my hand-picked collection and help others discover the perfect ride — whether you're after classic curves, modern muscle, or something with just the right growl under the hood. And yes, expect a touch of dry humour along the way — because why take life too seriously when you’ve got horsepower? Thanks for stopping by. Buckle up — it’s going to be one hell of a ride.</p>

	<p>I’ve been fascinated by cars for as long as I can remember. As a kid, I’d spend hours watching races and tinkering with model cars, completely mesmerized by the roar of engines and the beauty of each design. What started as simple curiosity grew into a lifelong passion — I began to see cars not just as machines, but as pieces of history and art. Each car I collect has its own story, a reflection of a time, a place, and a spirit of innovation that I want to preserve. For me, collecting cars isn’t just a hobby — it’s a way of keeping that excitement and craftsmanship alive.</p>
